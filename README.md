# Reflexi√≥n de clase
I consider the class to be rather difficult as it dealt with a heavy amount of content to cover in the mere five weeks of which only two days we had class, yet the teacher knew how to make adjustments to make the class understandable and interactive through the participation award (Stickers), it's the details that make it bearable to undergo plenty of topics to cover such as linear programming and graph results. In particular, I got my questions answered for mini case 1 and other problems from postwork in which we had to differentiate if it was asking for maximizing profits or minimizing costs, as well as setting constraints with their respective parameters to get an optimal solution. Likewise, we also  learned to use things like Google Colba which served as a better alternative to other programs as it let you see the step-by-step process of coding and using the different packages for forecasting and predictions (matplotlib, pandas, seaborn for dataset, numpy, and statsmodel), displaying the dataset with .head(), its specific variables with .describe(), creating histograms, scatterplots, and heatmaps, and do the prediction itself. Coding for me is a very broad topic and it was quite ambitious to see it being tackled in such a short time period but that isn't to say it was all right, I thought there should've been more "coding together" as a group so no one fell behind (especially because of team activities) but overall was an interesting experience.
